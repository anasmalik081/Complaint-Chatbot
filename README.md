# ü§ñ Cyfuture Complaint Chatbot

This project is a simple RAG-based chatbot application designed to collect and track customer complaints interactively. It combines a **FastAPI backend** for managing complaint records and a **Streamlit UI** for user interaction. The chatbot also uses **LangChain with Google Gemini embeddings** to provide contextual responses based on a sample knowledge base (PDF).
